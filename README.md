# AB Test and Regression - Project

<p>For this project, I will be working to run an A/B test and analyse its results for an e-commerce company. They want to increase user conversion rate through their web page. I will also use regression to as an alternative method to answer the question at hand</p>

<p>The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should adopt the new page (which is newly made for them), keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.</p>
