# AB Test and Regression - Project

### Analyze A/B Test Results

<p>For this project, I will be working to run an A/B test for the an e-commerce company. They want to increase user conversion rate through their web page. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should adopt the new page (which is newly made for them), keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.</p>

<p>An experiment was run by the company on two groups of users, control and treatment. Control group was directed to the old page when they sign-in. Treatment group was directed to the new page when they sign-in.</p>
